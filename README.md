This project creates an etching browser

This browser allows a user to draw on a canvas. The browser provides color
options including default/black, user picked color, rainbow effect, grayscale.
It also has an eraser color mode and a clear button. To be refined in the future.

NOTE: As I understood, if I want to stay true to this asignment, I'd have to
leave the html page empty and only create elements using scripts. However, I 
personally feels like the resulting code will be ugly and confusing.
